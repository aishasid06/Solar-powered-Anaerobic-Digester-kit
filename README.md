This is an individual engineering design solution presented as a coursework as part of the Engineering for People Design Challenge 2023.

This document addresses the challenges such as unreliable access to electricity faced by households in Pu Ngaol, Cambodia. They bear the daily burden of collecting firewood for daily tasks such as cooking. This one-time solution introduces "Make your own Solar-powered Anaerobic Digester at home" kits, each capable of serving two households. These kits are crafted from recycled materials and utilize organic waste to produce a stable supply of natural gas for cooking. By reducing their dependence on electricity, this approach not only simplifies their cooking process but also contributes to a carbon emission reduction of approximately 99%. It also provides 28 employment opportunities and achieves breakeven in 10 years.

The document conatins:
1. Problem Statement
2. Solution
   1. Design Components & Functionality
   2. Alignment with Design Criteria
   3. Alignment with UN SDGs
3. Guesstimation Calculations - technical, business, environmental & social impact

Note: The graded version contains the feedback from a university course marker towards the end.
